# PyBer-Analysis


### Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to show the summary of differences in ride-sharing data from different city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. 
We found the: 
  * Total Number of Rides
  * Total Number of Drivers
  * The Sum of the Fares
  * Average Fare per ride
  * Average Fare per Driver
  
We then took a sample of that data from Jan-Apr 2019 and created a multi-line chart showing the Total Fare by City Type to provide a quick visual insight into any trends.


### Results

The below shows a summary from this dataset:

This shows that clearly that urban cities have the largest and most utilized ridesharing market. However, the oversaturation of drivers in urban cities means that the average fare per trip and per driver is significantly lower than those in suburban or rural cities. There are 2405 drivers but only 1625 rides. You would expect there to be a significantly higher number of rides to drivers given that each driver would be doing several rides per day. This indicates there is a large number of inactive drivers that are driving down the 'average fare per driver' results. Rural environments have far fewer drivers but the ones that are there have a significantly higher fare per trip. This could be because the trips are, by default, larger distances but it could also be because they are much in demand and their rates could be set higher. Suburban cities sit in the middle and drivers make a reasonable fare per ride and might be a good choice for drivers that don't want to deal with urban city driving or very long distances.      

### Summary

Some suggestions to the CEO to address city type disparities:
1) During less busy times in urban cities, drivers may be encouraged to branch out into rural and suburban areas to find passengers. 
2) The disparity between number of drivers in urban cities and the number of rides indicates that there are a signficant number of inactive drivers. One would assume that one driver would provide numerous trips in one shift but these numbers do not align. Perhaps analyzing activity rates per driver would show inactive registered drivers who could be removed to result in more accurate fare data per driver amount.  
3) Do any of the spikes in usage fall around holidays or special events? Are there particularly busy times of the day? Further analysis of the data would result in more information that can be used to justify surge pricing or determine particular times to have more or fewer drivers on the road.
